I created the "gatt-to-wto" repository to dive into the transition from the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) to the World Trade Organization (WTO). It’s a topic that’s ripe for exploration, and I wanted to put my insights into a structured document. 

## Why This Project Exists

Trade agreements shape global commerce and can significantly alter economies. GATT laid the groundwork for international trade, and when the WTO emerged, it was a game-changer. This project aims to clarify how these two entities relate and coexist. 

In essence, I wanted to peel back the layers of these trade agreements. While research on this topic is abundant, I felt a comprehensive document summarizing my findings would be incredibly useful for anyone interested. It’s not just an academic exercise; it’s about understanding the implications these agreements have on daily life, business, and policy.

## Key Design Decisions

### Document Format

I chose to create the main content in a Microsoft Word document (.docx) for a couple of reasons:

- **Familiarity:** Many users are comfortable with Word, making it more accessible for those who may not be tech-savvy.
- **Rich Features:** Word allows for robust formatting, images, and styles that enhance the presentation of the information.

The project is structured simply, with a primary document and a supplementary folder. 

### Supplementary Files

The `full-txt` directory houses plain text files. I included these for anyone who wants to dig deeper into specific topics without sifting through the main document. 

## Tech Stack

- **Microsoft Word (.docx):** Main document format for thorough documentation.
- **Plain Text Files:** Additional resources, easily viewable and editable.

## Project Structure

To give you a quick look at what I’ve built, here’s how the repository is organized:

```
FromGattotheWTO.docx  # Main document file
full-txt/             # Folder containing additional text files
```

## Getting Started

This is straightforward—since the repository focuses primarily on documentation, there’s no complicated setup required. 

To check out the main document:
1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open `FromGattotheWTO.docx` with Microsoft Word or any compatible word processor.

For the supplementary files:
1. Navigate to the `full-txt` directory.
2. Open any text file with your preferred text editor.

## Trade-offs in Choices

I had to weigh convenience against depth. Using Word makes it accessible but sacrifices version control benefits that Markdown or HTML offer. While the Word format is user-friendly, it limits collaborative editing and tracking changes. That’s something I’m considering addressing in future iterations of the project.

## Future Work / Roadmap

I have a few ideas on how to improve this repository going forward:

- **Format Conversion:** Transform the Word document into Markdown or HTML. This will enhance accessibility and allow for better version control.
- **Summaries and Annotations:** I’d like to add summaries to the supplementary text files. These can help clarify complex topics without reading the entire document.
- **Metadata Improvements:** Adding metadata or tags could significantly enhance searchability and organization.
- **Data Tools:** Eventually, I’d explore creating scripts to analyze or extract useful insights from the text files for researchers or policymakers.
- **Documentation Clarity:** Finally, I want to clarify the repository's purpose and scope for a broader audience to understand its value.

## Stay in the Loop

I’m passionate about sharing updates and insights from this project as it evolves. You can follow my journey on social media—Mastodon, Bluesky, Twitter/X—where I’ll share developments, gather feedback, and connect with like-minded people.

## Conclusion

The "gatt-to-wto" project is a personal endeavor aimed at demystifying complex trade agreements that impact our world. By making this information accessible, I hope to contribute to the conversation around global trade. The project is a work in progress, and I’m excited about the improvements I have planned. If you’re interested in trade agreements, feel free to check out the repository and let me know what you think. Your feedback is always welcome!
