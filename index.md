# Technical Overview: gatt-to-wto Repository

## Motivation

The repository appears to focus on the historical and legal transition from the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) to the World Trade Organization (WTO). This transition is a significant event in international trade policy and law, with implications for trade regulation and dispute resolution.

## Problem Statement

Understanding the evolution from GATT to WTO requires detailed examination of legal texts, policy documents, and historical context. This repository consolidates such information, presumably to support research, analysis, or educational purposes.

## Project Composition

The repository contains a primary Word document (`FromGattotheWTO.docx`) which likely holds the core analysis or narrative. Additionally, there is a directory named `full-txt` which probably contains related textual data or source materials.

The use of a Word document suggests the content is formatted for readability and presentation rather than programmatic interaction. The supplementary files may provide raw data or extended content.

## Implementation Details

- The main document is packaged in the `.docx` format, a zipped XML-based file structure, indicating the use of Microsoft Word or compatible editors.
- The presence of XML files inside the `.docx` archive shows standard Office Open XML structure.
- The `full-txt` folder likely contains plain text files, which may be used for reference, indexing, or further processing.

## Practical Considerations

For future development or usage:

- Converting the document to Markdown or HTML would facilitate integration with version control systems and web platforms.
- Parsing the supplementary text files could enable automated analysis or extraction of key information.
- Adding metadata and documentation would improve usability for collaborators or future revisits.

## Summary

This repository serves as a container for a detailed study on the GATT to WTO transition. While currently document-centric, it provides a foundation for further technical enhancements to support research workflows and data accessibility.
